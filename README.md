# A Statistical Analysis of Environmental Factorsâ€™ Impact on San Diego Parks

The project investigates the relationships between the yelp rating scores and CES 2.0 scores. It further examines whether there are correlations between the yelp rating and pollution-related indices within CES 2.0 algorithm, including the Particulate Matter 2.5 index, Diesel Particulate Matter index, and Drinking Water index. The result shows a negative correlation statistically significant between the yelp rating and CES 2.0 scores and no correlation between the yelp rating and pollution-related indices.
